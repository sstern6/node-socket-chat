# Node-Socket-Chat


##How to start

I have included a list of fundamental dependecies to help you run the program I have created.

You will need 2 terminal windows open at one time to run the application successfully.

-First run npm install to download all of the dependencies I have provided in the packag.json file

-Then open a new windown in the terminal and run "mongod" at the root of your computer to start the mongo server.

-Finally change directories into the directory you have cloned this repo into, and run app.js


##The project

This is a project for Phase 2 of Week 2 at Dev Bootcamp.  The project was to learn a new technology in 5 days and I choose to work with Node JS, Socket.io, and I also incorporated MongoDB as a stretch challenge.  With the given technologies I built a chatroom that display the author of the message and some small chatroom featrues to understand the capabilities of Node JS with socket.io.
